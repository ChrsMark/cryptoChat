# Linux Chat over tcp/ip

This repository holds configuration files and dashboards for the ELK stack used to monitor the Openstack Cluster of [*CSLab Ntua*](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/).

This project is part of my Diploma Thesis.

This project consists of 3 parts.

Part1: Simple chat implementation in C language, using sockets.

Part2: Enriching simple chat by adding en/de-cryption features using opensourse cryptographic device.

Part3: Implementing a paravirtualized crypto-device to be used by the chat application. This device is being developed according to the [*VirtIo protocol*](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-virtio/)

The whole project is an assigment for the [*Operating Systems Laboratory course summer 2015*](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/courses/compsyslab/) at NTUA ECE.
